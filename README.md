# MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis

## Overview
This project is designed to analyze production data from AutosRU's newest car model, the Mecha Car.  The analysis is performed using RStudio and the dplyr package. A linear regression model is created in order to predict the MOG of the Mecha Car.  Then summary statistics and t-tests are performed on the car manufacturing across 3 different lots.  Finally, a statistical study is designed to compare the statistics of the Mecha Car, to cras from other manufacturers.
